# Reminder

The midterm is on <span style="color:blue">Apr 2nd (Tue)</span>. 

The topic is general equilibrium. 


???
+ Just a reminder, the midterm is on Apr 2nd, Tuesday. The topic is general equilibrium like you practiced with this week's assignment. 

+ This time, unlike Steve, Jay is relatively strict about exam time, so I recommend that you think about how to allocate your time. 


+ Again, you have options, if you understand the proof of Walras's law, 1st welfare theorem, and existence theorem under the assumption of strict convex preferences, then you can choose problems involving proof. Otherwise, I guess you need to solve four different GE problems. Some of them might be tricky. So, be prepared.

# Quick review of Assignment 1


"Show that the derived Walrasian equilibrium allocation is PO" (or maybe you could be asked "Show that the first welfare theorem holds for this economy")

<br>

For this type of question, you have several approaches:

**Approach 1**: plug $x^{\ast}$ into the contract curve and confirm that it returns $y^{\ast}$

**Approach 2**: Check $MRS_1=MRS_2$
+ Only valid for interior outcomes. For corner outcomes, this does not hold. 

**Approach 3**: If preferences are all LNS, then you can invoke the 1st welfare theorem. 

**Approach 4**: Argue that any movement away from the equilibrium makes someone worse off. 


???
+ Some questions in assignment 1 asked to check whether the derived Walrasian equilibrium is PO. I received some questions from some of you, so let me clarify this point. 


+ There are several approaches.

# Exercise problem

*Practice makes perfect*

???
+ I want to do lots of practice problems with you guys. Because, first of all, of course,  if you practice more, then you can learn lots of variations of general equilibrium problems, which in turn will be helpful for you to understand the concepts of 1st, 2nd welfare theorem, and the existence theorems.   

+ Second, some general equilibrium problems in the exam or prelim are tricky, if you haven't seen the similar problem, it might take more time. This is an especially big problem in the exam and prelim.   

+ I recommend you go through all the problems in the Jay's textbook. I did that last year. 
+ Maybe you don't have time to work on these problems but you should do them as least once before the prelim. Actually, most of the problems in this textbooks are from past prelim exams. So, you can expect a similar difficulty level of problems will be asked in the prelim. 

+ One thing that I wanted to mention is that even if you decided to commit to not doing the proofs, you still need to know about the theorem. For example, what is the strong form of the Walras's Law, and in what condition do they hold. 

+ For example, in what condition, we need to use 1st welfare theorem? What about 2nd welfare theorem? (First of all, preferences have to satisfy continuous, convex, and strictly monotone. Also, 2nd welfare theorem is only applicable to interior allocations.)

# Exercise problem

.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-2.ph2.mt2[

Consider the following specific $2 \times 2$ competitive exchange economy, with consumers $j=1,2$ and goods $x$ and $y$. The consumers' preferences and initial endowments are given as follows:

+ Consumer 1: $U_1(x_1, y_1)=x_1y_1 \quad \text{and} \quad \omega_1=(12,4)$
+ Consumer 2: $U_2(x_2, y_2)=max[x_2, y_2]\quad \text{and} \quad\omega_2=(4,12)$

1. Find the set of Pareto-optimal allocations for this economy. You do not need to provide a mathematical derivation. Construct a carefully labeled Edgeworth-box diagram depicting the economy, including the endowment and at least one indifference curve for each consumer. Indicate the contract curve in your diagram.

2. True or False: This economy has a Walrasian equilibrium? If true, find the equilibrium price vector and allocation. If false, explain why the equilibrium does not exist.

# June 2022 Prelim 

Consider a $2 \times 2$ competitive exchange economy, where subscript $j = 1, 2$ indexes consumers and goods are $x$ and $y$. Preferences are represented by the utility functions $U_2(x_1, y_1)=x_1y_1$ and $U_2(x_2, y_2)=x_2+2y_2$. The initial endowment vectors are $\omega_1=(6,10)$ and $\omega_2=(6,0)$.

1. In an Edgeworth box diagram, indicate the endowment $\omega$ and draw indifference curves for each consumer. Also draw the contract curve, the set of Pareto-optimal allocations. Label your diagram carefully. 

2. Derive the demands $x_j(p, \omega_j)$ for the two consumers. Be sure to include demand behavior when prices are zero. 

3. Derive the Walrasian equilibrium price-allocation vector $(p^{\ast}, x^{\ast})$. Indicate and label the equilibrium, both $x^{\ast}$ and $p^{\ast}$, in your Edgeworth box from part (a).

4. Consider the PO allocation $x_1^{\prime}=(6,3)$ and $x_2^{\prime}=(6,7)$. Find a price vector, and also an alternative endowment vector $\omega^{\prime}$, that together will support this allocation as a Walrasian equilibrium.
