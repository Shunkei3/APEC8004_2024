One point advise: How to guess the shape of indifference curve?

+ Utility function is ordinal (the shape and location of indifference curve matters. The actual )
+ As long as the order won't change any function with the same ordinal property can be used. 
+ Monotonic transformation of ordinal function

???
+ utility was conceived as a quantitative measure of a personâ€™s welfare out of consuming goods. Now it is recognised that utility cannot be quantified because of the impossibility of interpersonal comparisons. So we do now as we did in Lesson 3, we only rank bundles.

+ The only property about the numbers the utility function generates which is important is how it orders the bundles; how it ranks them. The size of the difference between the numbers assigned to each bundle does not matter. Thus we talk about ordinal
utility.

Consider the following specific $2 \times 2$ competitive exchange economy, with consumers $j=1,2$ and goods $x$ and $y$. The consumers' preferences are given by $U_1(x_1, y_1)=(x_1+2)(x_2+2)$ and $U_2(x_2, y_2)=x_2$. Endowments are $\omega_1=(6,0)$ and $\omega_2=(6,12)$. We allow zero prices. 

1. Derive the demand correspondences for these two consumers, being careful to specify demand behavior when $p_i=0$.

2. *True or False*: This economy has a Walrasian equilibrium, by which is meant a price vector $p^{\ast}$ and associated allocation $x^{\ast}$ at which demand is non-positive for each good: $z(p^{\ast}) \leq 0$. If true, find the equilibrium price vector and allocation. If false, provide a detailed explanation and state carefully all of the reasons why the existence result from (a) does not apply here.

Consider a $2 \times 2$ competitive exchange economy, where subscript $j = 1, 2$ indexes consumers and goods are $x$ and $y$. Preferences are represented by the utility functions $U_1(x_1, y_1)=x_1y_1$ and $U_2(x_2, y_2)=x_2+2y_2$. The initial endowment vectors are $\omega_1=(6,10)$ and $\omega_2=(6,0)$.

1. In an Edgeworth box diagram, indicate the endowment $\omega$ and draw indifference curves for each consumer. Also draw the contract curve, the set of Pareto-optimal allocations. Label your diagram carefully. 

2. Derive the demands $x_j(p, \omega_j)$ for the two consumers. Be sure to include demand behavior when prices are zero. 

3. Derive the Walrasian equilibrium price-allocation vector $(p^{\ast}, x^{\ast})$. Indicate and label the equilibrium, both $x^{\ast}$ and $p^{\ast}$, in your Edgeworth box from part (a).

4. Consider the PO allocation $x_1^{\prime}=(6,3)$ and $x_2^{\prime}=(6,7)$. Find a price vector, and also an alternative endowment vector $\omega^{\prime}$, that together will support this allocation as a Walrasian equilibrium. 




Consider the following $2\times 2$ competitive exchange economy, with consumers $j=1,2$ and goods $x$ and $y$. The consumers' preferences are given by:
\begin{equation*}
U_1(x_1,y_1 )= \ln x_1  + 2\ln y_1 \quad\text{and}\quad U_2(x_2,y_2 )= \min \{2\ln x_2,\ln y_2\} .
\end{equation*}
  
Endowments are $\omega_1 = (3/4,1/4)$ and $\omega_2 = (1/4,3/4)$. 


1. Derive the contract curve for this economy. Construct a carefully 
labeled Edgeworth-box diagram depicting the economy, including the endowment, 
an indifference curve for each consumer, and the contract curve. 

2. Derive the two consumers' offer curves (demands). Find a Walrasian 
equilibrium for the economy. Show that the equilibrium allocation is also Pareto 
optimal. Add the equilibrium allocation and equilibrium price line to your 
diagram.
